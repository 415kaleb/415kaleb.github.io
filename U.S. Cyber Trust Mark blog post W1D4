I think this is a great idea to let people know how secure their devices are. I think it’s interesting how Amazon  and Best Buy completely support this, especially since they provide a lot of devices to the public, and don’t actually create them and have the task of getting them verified. It also provides people safety since they get to know how secure their security systems are and how hard or easy it is to breach and shut them off from a hacker’s perspective. Something I want to know is how companies that purposely sell cheap unsecure devices will react and respond to the U.S. Cyber Trust Mark. I think it will affect smaller companies who need to pay the fee of getting the mark on their devices, since they will lose money is the get the mark and also if they don’t.
