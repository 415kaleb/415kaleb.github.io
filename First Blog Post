The most interesting part of cybersecurity for me is how easy it is for someone to access your information. Someone could easily gain access to your laptop when you connect to their wifi which is really surprising to me. Another interesting thing is how complicated learning linux is. As someone with no experience, it's a struggle to understand concepts and how to use so mamy different commands. Something I'm looking forward to learn about is the basics of protecting your devices from cyber attacks and how to prevent viruses.
