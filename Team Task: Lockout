First we used IF config to help us find the netmask. 
Then we used Sudo nmap -O 10.0.140.3/22 to see all the IP Addresses on the network. 
Then we wrote down all the ips we found. We checked all the other computers on the network to narrow down ip addresses to 3.
We shut down two of the three to determine each of the ipâ€™s and found our ip address. 
Next we asked Corey for a hint and used the hint to download hydraNext. 
We asked Corey for another hint and found out about rockyou.txt. Using find -H, we found and unarchived the file and  we copied rockyou.txt from coreys computer to ours using scp.
We used the command Hydra -l user -P rockyou.txt ftp://10.0.140.5 to see the passwords. 
Finally Hydra told us the password was iloveyou.
