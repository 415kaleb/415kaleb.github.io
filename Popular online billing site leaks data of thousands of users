My initial reaction is shock, I wonder how a billing site can leave so much crucial information unprotected. I'm surprised how careless Willow Pays are. I also wonder if this goes the same for other billing companies, and how easy is it to access important and personal information like this. I'm also astonished how they had so much information, about 240,000 records, just left exposed to the public and extremely vulnerable.
