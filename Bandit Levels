Level 0: Use the given username, location, port, and password with the command ssh to log in to the game.
Level 0-1: Once logged in, use ls to list all files and directories, then use cat to open "readme", the contents inside is the password for the next level.
level 1-2: use ls to list everything, then use "cat ./-" to open the only file and use the contents as the next password.
Level 2-3: use ls to list everything, then use cat "(file name)" to open the file and use it as the next password.
Level 3-4: use ls to  list everything, then use cd to change directories to "inhere". Then use ls -a to list all things, then open "...Hiding-From-You" and use the contents as the next password.
Level 4-5: Change directories to "inhere" then list everything. Next, open "-file07 " and use the contents as the next password. 
Level 5-6: se ls to  list everything, then use cd to change directories to "inhere". then do  "find -size 1033c -readable". The results will show "./maybehere07/.file2". Next, do "cd maybehere07" which can be followed by "cat .file2" which will give you the password.
level 6-7: The password for the next level is stored somewhere on the server and has all of the following properties:, owned by user bandit7, owned by group bandit6, 33 bytes in size. Use the command "find / -type f -user bandit7 -group bandit6 -size 33c 2> /dev/null" to specify what you're trying to find. Open the resulting file with cat and use the contents as the next password. 
Level 7-8: open data.txt using cat after using ls, then use command f on the keyboard and type in millionth to see where it is in the file, finally, use the text following it as the password for the next level.
Level 8-9: After using ls, use cat to open data.txt, use the command "sort data.txt | uniq -u" and use the response as the next password.
Level 9-10: Use the command "strings “======” data.txt" and look for the set of characters following a few "=" and use it as the next password. 
level 10-11: Once data.txt is opened with car, use the command "base64 -d data.txt" to decode it, and the contents give the password for the next level.
Level 11-12: read the given link on rot13, then use the command "cat data.txt | tr ‘A-Za-z’ ‘N-ZA-Mn-za-m’" and it will give you the password. 
level 12-13: I honestly had to use an outside source for this, I used thisi site: https://medium.com/@br4ind3ad/overthewire-bandit-level-12-13-c7bac2e8f297 
Level 13-14: The password for the next level is stored in /etc/bandit_pass/bandit14 and can only be read by user bandit14. For this level, you don’t get the next password, but you get a private SSH key that can be used to log into the next level. Note: localhost is a hostname that refers to the machine you are working on. First i used "ls". Then I opened sshkey.private with "cat sshkey.private ". Then i used the command "ssh -i sshkey.private bandit14@localhost -p 2220" to log in. 
Level 14-15: Once on Level 14, I did " cat /etc/bandit_pass/bandit14" to find the pass word for the next level. I then used the command "nc localhost 30000" and submitted the password and was given another password for the next level. THen exit and use that password to get to level 15.
Level 15-16: The password for the next level can be retrieved by submitting the password of the current level to port 30001 on localhost using SSL/TLS encryption. I used the command "openssl s_client -connect localhost:30001" and submitted the password for the current level and got the new password for the next level. The first command i did was "nmap -sV localhost -p 31000-32000". This maps out the entire network, then I looked through each of the few ports for which ones had the ssl service, and found 2 of them, "31790/tcp" and "31960/tcp". 
Level 16-17: I first used to command "nmap -sV localhost -p 31000-32000". Then I did "openssl s_client -connect localhost:31790 -quiet" to open the port 31790. and gave me a private key. I put that key into a file with nano and named it 'sshkey17.privatee". I tested the permisions with the file with "ls - l sshkey17.privatee" and changed it so i could get better permisions with "chmod 600 sshkey17.privatee". Then, I logged into the next level with "ssh -i sshkey17.privatee bandit17@localhost -p 2220" I'm pretty sure you always have to log into level 16 BEFORE logging into 17 always, in case you want to go straight into level 17.
Level 17-18: There are 2 files in the homedirectory: passwords.old and passwords.new. The password for the next level is in passwords.new and is the only line that has been changed between passwords.old and passwords.new. The first command I did was " diff passwords.old passwords.new", and since "passwords.new" was the second thing i put, the password is the second thing from the output, so i used that as the next password. 
Level 18-19: The password for the next level is stored in a file readme in the homedirectory. Unfortunately, someone has modified .bashrc to log you out when you log in with SSH. I used the command "ssh bandit18@bandit.labs.overthewire.org -p 2220 -t "/bin/sh" then used ls to list files. Finally I used cat to open the file and use the contents as the next password. 
Level 19-20: To gain access to the next level, you should use the setuid binary in the homedirectory. Execute it without arguments to find out how to use it. The password for this level can be found in the usual place (/etc/bandit_pass), after you have used the setuid binary. I used the command "ls -la" and found out the owner is badit20 and the group is bandit19, this with ‘-rwsr-x—’ means the user bandit19 can execute the binary, but the binary is executed as user bandit20. Then I used "./bandit20-do", followed by ./bandit20-do ls /etc/bandit_pass. Finally, I used  ./bandit20-do cat /etc/bandit_pass/bandit20 and used the contents as the password. 
Level 20-21: There is a setuid binary in the homedirectory that does the following: it makes a connection to localhost on the port you specify as a commandline argument. It then reads a line of text from the connection and compares it to the password in the previous level (bandit20). If the password is correct, it will transmit the password for the next level (bandit21).
