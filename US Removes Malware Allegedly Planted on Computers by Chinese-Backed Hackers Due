Something I find intersting after learning about the cybersecurity world is how much governments rely and use illegal tactics with criminals to hack and install malware on foreign computers. Another thing that surpised me is how long this malware has been in action. According to the article, it has been used since 2014, and it's astonishing how malware has affected thousands of computers for a decace, and it's only getting attention recently. I'm also surpised how the malware was installed via usb. Usually, I would think malware is installed remotely, but physically inserting a usb with no one noticing on 4,000 devices is surprising.
